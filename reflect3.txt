When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When I want to collaborate with others.

We pull manually for control.  Sometimes we may not want others changes in our local repo just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?
- Forks are private to GitHub, that is you only fork one GitHub repo to another
GitHub repo.
- Clones are for creating a local repo from a remote (even if the remote is 
anothe local directory on your machine!)
- branches are references to a commit.  A branch is usually created locally and then
pushed to the remote (after fist pulling from the remote in case others have made
changes).
